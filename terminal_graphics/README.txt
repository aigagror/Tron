This is a basic terminal graphics I've built.

Use 'make' to, well, make it.

Check out main.c, it shows how to use it from a client-based perspective. It should be pretty simply.

NOTE: In order to run, you need to have curses installed. If you use the 241 VM, just copy the following:
sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev
