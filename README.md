# Tron
Hi welcome to my group's project!

This project demonstrates our knowledge of networking using the TCP protocol

Type in "make all" to get the latest server and client executables.

On the server side, run "./tron_server.out <port-num-to-use> -players <number-of-players> -width <board-width> -height <board-height> -fps <frames-per-second>" (you can also add the "-debug" flag if you want)

On the client side, run "./tron_client.out <server-ip-address> <server-port-number>" (you can also add the "-debug" flag if you want)

Both executables come with default settings which will create a server within your computer so you can run both "./tron_server.out" and 2 instances of "./tron_client.out" to start a game.

Have fun!
